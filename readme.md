**collaborative-operations** is a tool that helps to turn longâ€“term blocking operations into collaborative ones with minimal changes to the code.

The main functionality is implemented in the [CollaborativeQueue](src/main/java/ru/dksu/CollaborativeQueue.java) class,which also contains auxiliary functions for easier application of the mechanism to existing structures. To describe the subtasks that will be performed by the main and auxiliary threads, it is necessary to implement the [CollaborativeTask](src/main/java/ru/dksu/CollaborativeTask.java) interface.

The [example](src/main/java/ru/dksu/example) directorycontains examples of applying the mechanism to two structures: a thread-safe HashMap (for rebuilding, snapshot, and reduce operations), as well as LockBasedStanfordTreeMap (for snapshot and reduce operations), which are tested using the LinCheck tool. The corresponding tests are located in the [test](src/test/java/ru/dksu) directory.
